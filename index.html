      <h2>Diesel</h2>
        <img src="img/desiel.jpeg" alt="good cat diesel">
<p>Diesel is a retired Iditarod race from Alaska. He is a 14 year old cat with thousands of miles under his paws. He is pretty specific when it comes to his diet, liking only wet food or freshly caught mice from southern France (don't ask us why). He will spend most of his days soaking up the sun via a south facing window.</p>
